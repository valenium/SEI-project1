# Doge Checkers

# Description
Welcome to Doge Checkers! This is a two player game played on a single browser, where each will take a turn one after another. The objective of the game is to capture all of the other player's pieces, and whoever is the last remaining wins! 

Each player will begin with 12 pieces, which they can move diagonally on the dark squares on an 8x8 checkered board. Players can capture each each other's pieces by jumping diagonally and can even double jump should their opponents pieces be aligned properly. Players can only move forward however, if a player is succesfully able to get one of their pieces to the opposite end of the board, that piece becomes a king and can move backwards. Once one of the players emerges victorious, it will be game over and the board resets

BUT... this is no regular game of checkers... this is Doge Checkers. In addition to being doge themed, doge will be judging your every move with snarky little comments until it witnesses the demise of one side.
